# I've been double charged

First of all. A double charge is not a common issue, but it might still happen because of the nature of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The good news is it is pretty easy to sort out.

There are a few reasons you might see a double charge from MyWay:

#### 1. Hold not correctly handled by your bank <a href="#h_f37520469e" id="h_f37520469e"></a>

If you've recently subscribed to MyWay, a double charge might be caused by a hold. Apple and Google place a hold on your account to see if there are sufficient funds. As soon as you finish your free trial and the first charge goes through, the hold is removed by Apple or Google. Unfortunately, some banks don't handle this correctly. Instead, they show the hold as a charge and may take up to a month before showing the hold has been removed. Please let us know if the hold isn't removed after 1 month.

#### 2. Your previous payment was late <a href="#h_845ae006ea" id="h_845ae006ea"></a>

If you were late paying your subscription fee last month, Apple or Google could charge you twice for last month and this month. A double charge might also occur if your subscription was automatically canceled because Apple/Google couldn't charge the payment, and now you've restarted the subscription.

#### 3. Accidentally bought a subscription twice <a href="#h_fa2e6e75db" id="h_fa2e6e75db"></a>

If you've accidentally bought a MyWay subscription twice on an Apple device, Apple will automatically refund the double charge. You can check [your Apple purchases here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204088).

If you've accidentally bought a subscription twice or started 2 free trials on Google Play, [you can check that here](https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions). Please [cancel](https://help.getcircuit.com/article/44-cancel-your-subscription) one of them and [apply for a refund](https://help.getcircuit.com/article/63-refund).

#### 4. Started a subscription on both Apple and Android <a href="#h_de3ce1f52b" id="h_de3ce1f52b"></a>

You might have started a subscription on both an Apple and an Android device. You can [check that here for Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204088) and [here for Android](https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions). Please [cancel](https://help.getcircuit.com/article/44-cancel-your-subscription) the account you don't want to use anymore and [apply for a refund here](https://help.getcircuit.com/article/63-refund).

#### 5. Other <a href="#h_b60472697a" id="h_b60472697a"></a>

If none of the above helps, you can also dispute all charges at your bank. If you wait for 1 month, all disputed charges will be canceled, and now you can safely start a new subscription. If that doesn't help either, please contact us and send us a screenshot of all charges, and we will be able to assist you.
