# How can I get a refund?

If you were charged after cancelling the subscription or forgot to cancel your free trial and have been charged, you might be eligible for a refund.

You might be eligible for a refund if:

1. You did not refund an application subscription before (this should be your first application refund).
2. The time between the subscription charge date and your refund request date is no longer than seven (7) days.
3. You did not use application premium features between the subscription charge date and your refund request date.

Please keep in mind **if you cancel a subscription and request a refund, you will not be able to use the application's premium features**.

We do not store your credit card details and do not charge your bank account directly. All purchases on iPhone or iPad go through the Apple App Store, and all purchases on Android devices are handled by Google Play Market.

**Unfortunately, we can't issue refunds from our end**, as we don't have any direct control over refunds, but you can follow the instructions below to apply for a refund on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

### **Apple App Store (iPhone, iPad)** <a href="#apple-app-store" id="apple-app-store"></a>

[Here are the instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084) on how you can apply for a refund on the Apple app store. Apple will review each case individually.

### Google Play Store (Android) <a href="#h_4f481eb860" id="h_4f481eb860"></a>

If you were charged in the past 48 hours, Google will most likely refund the charges right away. If the charge was more than 48 hours ago, Google will consider your refund request, depending on the circumstances.
