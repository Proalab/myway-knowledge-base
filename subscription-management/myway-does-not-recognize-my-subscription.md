# MyWay does not recognize my subscription

You have an active subscription and paid the subscription fee this month. However, you can't access the full version of MyWay because the app asks you to start another free trial.

### **Apple App Store (iPhone, iPad):** <a href="#ios-iphone-or-ipad" id="ios-iphone-or-ipad"></a>

* In MyWay Route Planner, click the menu icon on the top right side of the app, find "Restore Purchases" in the Premium section, and click on it. Wait for the app to restore your purchase.

If the first option doesn't work, please delete and reinstall the app to resolve the issue.

### **Google Play Store (Android):**

* Delete the app and reinstall it to resolve the issue.
* When downloading the app, make sure you use the same Google Play account you originally used to subscribe to MyWay. To change accounts on the Google Play Store, [follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2521798?hl=en).

Please be aware that sharing a subscription between Android and iOS is impossible. For example, If you started a subscription on Android, you won't be able to access the full version of MyWay Route Planner on your iPhone unless you start a separate subscription on iPhone (and pay for a subscription on both Android and iPhone).

If you want to [share your subscription with family members](does-app-support-family-sharing-on-ios.md).

Please be aware that if you try to restore a subscription, but the subscription is not restored, it means you don't have an active subscription for this account. Please make sure you are using the same AppleID Account on both devices.
