# Why can't I buy a subscription?

There are multiple reasons why you can't buy a subscription. The most obvious are:&#x20;

* There is not enough money in your account to buy a subscription.
* There is something wrong with your Payment Method.

Please check none of the above applied to you, and if everything looks good, please check if there is any specific issue related to your App Store. The most common store problems are below:

### **Apple App Store (iPhone, iPad)** <a href="#ios-iphone-or-ipad" id="ios-iphone-or-ipad"></a>

* Your App Store account is not allowed to make an in-app purchase ([https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204396](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204396))
* You use a different Apple ID account for purchases, which has its own limitations or issues ([https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207937](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207937)). &#x20;

### Google Play Store (Android)

* Your payment method is likely wrong. [Please make sure your payment method is not expired](how-to-change-or-add-a-payment-method.md).
* Please make sure your account has not been blocked or restricted by Google.

Each and every case has its own way of resolving it. If you have been facing any of these issues, please refer to the official Apple App Store and Google Play Store documentation to resolve them.
