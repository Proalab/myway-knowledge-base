# Use MyWay on multiple devices

It's possible to use MyWay on multiple devices. To set up a second device, you need to log in with the Apple ID or Google account you used to initially subscribe to MyWay.

After logging in with the correct account, you need to either [restore the subscription](myway-does-not-recognize-my-subscription.md) on an iOS device or verify it on your Android device. Please check the instructions on how to do that [here](myway-does-not-recognize-my-subscription.md).

Keep in mind that **you can't share an account with another driver**. it's not possible to use different routes on multiple devices at the same time except if you have a business subscription (that supports route sharing between devices).

If you'd like to [change your payment method](how-to-change-or-add-a-payment-method.md) or [cancel the subscription](how-to-cancel-your-myway-subscription.md) later, you'll need to do that on the platform you've originally subscribed to (iOS or Android).
