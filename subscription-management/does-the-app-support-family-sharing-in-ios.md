# Does app support Family Sharing on iOS?

Family Sharing allows you and the other members of your household to share iTunes, App Store, and other purchases and subscriptions across all your family members and devices without having to purchase them multiple times. Unfortunately, at this point, MyWay does not support family sharing, so you can't share one subscription with your family members. The main reason for this is the inability to share route history and other settings that affect route optimization algorithms.&#x20;

We are sorry about that and will work to sort this out in the future, but the only option at this stage is to buy a separate subscription for each member of your family. \
