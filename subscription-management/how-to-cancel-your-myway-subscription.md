# How to cancel your MyWay subscription?

## **During your trial** <a href="#during-your-trial" id="during-your-trial"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not store your credit card details and do not charge your bank account directly. All purchases on iPhone or iPad go through the Apple App Store, and all purchases on Android devices are handled by Google Play Market.

## **After canceling** <a href="#after-cancelling" id="after-cancelling"></a>

If you're canceling due to issues with MyWay, it'd be great if you could send us a quick message using the chat icon at the bottom right or clicking "Talk to Us" in the app menu. This way, we can keep on improving the app for other drivers. We will appreciate it a lot!
