# How much does MyWay Route Planner cost?

For new users, we offer a plan that allows you to optimize up to 20 stops per route absolutely for free. If you need more than 20 stops per route, you can start your 7-day free trial to try out the full version of MyWay. A full version of MyWay Route Planner helps optimize more stops and provides better optimization algorithms.

#### Why do I have to pay?

We want to keep MyWay Route Planner free of charge, but in our modern world, it is not possible. Currently, we carry a significant cost to support the app infrastructure and pay for 3rd party services. Your data is not a source of our income, so we rely on a subscription mode to grow. We want everyone to have access to route optimization tools, so we decided to offer 20 stops per route for free, and our price is the most affordable on the market. Most of our competitors do not provide any free optimizations, and [some provide only between 5 and 10 stops for free](https://mywayroute.com/myway-route-planner-vs-alternatives).

#### Premium Options

At this moment, we have two[ premium options](https://mywayroute.com/pricing), and prices vary by country:

1. Premium for 1 month
2. Premium for 1 year

If you find MyWay unsuitable, you can cancel any time during your trial and won't be billed. If you continue using MyWay, the monthly (or annual) subscription will automatically start when your trial ends.

You can cancel your subscription at any time. After canceling, you'll have access to the app for the rest of your billing period, but you won't be billed again.
