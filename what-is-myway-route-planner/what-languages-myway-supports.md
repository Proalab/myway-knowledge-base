### [**How to help**](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#how-to-help) <a href="#how-to-help" id="how-to-help"></a>

First, you need to sign up on Crowdin (it's free).

The minimum you can do to help is go over the strings in your language in Crowdin, and upvote and/or downvote the translations that are good/bad. The more people do this, the better the final translation will be. And if you feel like suggesting a change (even small), please do, it's super easy.

#### [Context](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#context) <a href="#context" id="context"></a>

Make sure you read the context for each string on Crowdin (it's hidden by default and is positioned just under the english source string). Contexts look like paths, e.g. "setup -> guide -> platforms -> android -> guides -> private -> title".

#### [Be consistent](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#be-consistent) <a href="#be-consistent" id="be-consistent"></a>

Make sure the same terms are used throughout all the translations. This is important for tech terms (like "cryptojacking") but also for common verbs and nouns (like "log in", "sign up", "payment method", etc.).

#### [Tech terms](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#tech-terms)

For tech terms that originate from other companies (like "Google Maps" or "Apple Maps"), make sure you translate them exactly the same way as they do.

For more general tech terms (like "ETA" or "Time Windows"), our suggestion is to figure out how the popular tech press in your language usually name those. Wikipedia can also be a good way to figure this out (when available).

For menus and buttons mentioned in the Setup Guide, please match exactly the translations of the operating system or browser.

#### [Tags](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#tags) <a href="#tags" id="tags"></a>

Some translations contain tags like \{{tag\}}, \<n>\</n>, /n, @a, %2. Make sure the spaces before and after those tags are correct and match the original string in English. Be aware that Google Translate (the initial translation) tends to mess up those and add spaces around tags.

{% hint style="info" %}
In a few languages, spacing around tags needs to be different than in English. If you speak those languages, you will know what to do.
{% endhint %}

#### [Letter case](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#letter-case) <a href="#letter-case" id="letter-case"></a>

Using uppercase letters in the right places is important. English tends to uppercase a lot ("Delivery Time"), whereas other languages only uppercase the first letter of a sentence or term ("Délai de livraison" in French). Make sure you stay consistent and use the right casing for your language.

#### [Punctuation](https://help.nextdns.io/t/q6hmv0s/translations#punctuation) <a href="#punctuation" id="punctuation"></a>

Make sure you use the right punctuation (and the right spacing around them) for your language. For example, English uses “abc” for quoting, French uses «abc» and Traditional Chinese uses「abc」. Wikipedia is a good source of truth for those rules.
