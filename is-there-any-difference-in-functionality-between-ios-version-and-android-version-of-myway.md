# Is there any difference in functionality between iOS version and Android version of MyWay?

In short - yes. Not everything available on iOS is automatically available on Android and vice versa. At this stage, the iOS app has much more functionality and is superior to our Android app.

Our main goal is for the two apps to be as close as possible, but there are still some platform limitations and differences between these two. For example, Android features Google Maps by default and is missing Apple Maps and Apple geocoding entirely, as there is no way to add that to the Google Platform.&#x20;

Also, the Android app has a limited amount of search features (iOS has an address, map, contacts, favorites, multi-line list, import from file, and photo, audio; an Android has all of that except import from file). Overall, we aim to make all features available on Android around October 2025.
