# How many addresses can I add to a route?

If you're currently subscribed to MyWay on Android or iOS, it's possible to add [up to 200 stops](what-is-myway-route-planner/how-much-does-myway-route-planner-cost.md) to a single route, and, of course, you can create as many routes as you like.

At this moment, we have been working on a business version that will support up to 500 stops, multi-driver optimisation and business subscriptions.&#x20;
