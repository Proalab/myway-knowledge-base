# Import from file and multi-line import

MyWay Route Planner allows you to save time and import stops from multi-line imports, from files (.XSLS, .CSV), from other [apps](how-to-import-xlsx-files-from-other-apps.md), and even through links.

These features can save you a lot of time and hassle, as you can add many stops at once. To do so, simply click the "add stop" button (or click the search button at the very top left) > scroll down to the right > and choose multi-line import or import from file. If you import from a file, please make sure you use the correct format (an example can be found [here](import-from-file-and-multi-line-import.md#import-from-file-file-example)). Also, please allow some time for the app to process your list, as sometimes it can be a pretty long process (up to 3 minutes) as the app is trying to recognize all addresses and match them to the addresses database.

### Multiline Import

Please paste each address in a separate line and click the Search button. The app will then try to recognize the address. After that, you can edit the recognized address or click the "Select All" button on the bottom right side (or pick a specific address by clicking on it), and then click the "Done" button to add stops to the list.

### Import from File

If you pick the File option, please download the file example (example.xlsx) to see how the import file should look. We do accept .XLSX files and .CSV. The order of columns is not important as we use some smart algorithms to validate the data provided and assign correct data to specific fields based on data formats (if you need guidance or something is not going as expected, please check the file example to see the data formats we use). Then, after you have prepared your data, you can upload the file to the app by clicking the "Browse Files" button, finding the file you need on your phone, and processing it in the app.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you pick a file, you have to send it to your phone either by email, a messenger of your choice, or AirDrop from your computer. Please refer to How-To in the internet related to the option you pick.

Also, you can use [import from another app](how-to-import-xlsx-files-from-other-apps.md) option when you have a file on your your phone.
{% endhint %}

### Import from file - file Example

You can use the file below if you need an example of a .XLSS file that can be imported into MyWay Route Planner.

{% hint style="info" %}
The actual order of fields and column titles do not matter, but the format of the data does. Like example:&#x20;

Column names for addresses can be "address," "Full Address," "FullAddress," etc., but the format should be the text that geocoding services can recognize.
{% endhint %}

**We recommend using our example file and building your files based on it to reduce possible errors.** Please check example file below:
