# Using MyWay without an internet connection (Offline Mode)

### 1. Plan your route when you have an internet connection <a href="#id-1-setup-your-route-when-youre-connected" id="id-1-setup-your-route-when-youre-connected"></a>

MyWay needs an internet connection to

* Add stops
* Optimize your route

We recommend doing these steps when you have a reliable internet connection. MyWay doesn't require an internet connection for the rest of your route.

### 2. Download your area for offline navigation <a href="#id-2-download-your-area-for-offline-navigation" id="id-2-download-your-area-for-offline-navigation"></a>

If you might lose connection during your route, make your area available offline in your navigation app. This will ensure that you can still navigate to your stops as usual.

How to make your area available offline:

* [Instructions for Google Maps (recommended)](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\&hl=en)
* Instructions for [HERE WeGo](https://here.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/24000068342-how-can-i-download-and-use-offline-maps-)
* Instruction [Apple Maps](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/iphone/iphcfb5f5bc6/ios)
* _Waze currently don't support offline maps_

### 3. Now you can navigate through your route in offline mode <a href="#id-3-you-can-now-navigate-offline" id="id-3-you-can-now-navigate-offline"></a>

Once you've downloaded offline maps in an application you have chosen and have your route optimized and started, you'll be able to press Navigate in MyWay, and navigation will work even when you're without a connection.
