# What Service Time should you choose?

To get the most accurate route that is very well optimized for your needs, you need to choose service time correctly. As a Service Time may vary, it will change the overall route time and the time you arrive at each stop. The wrong service time has an especially dramatic effect on those stops that have time windows. Service Time (time on a stop) depends on the type of delivery (or business you are in). Please check recommended service type down below:

| Business                                                             | Recommended Service Time |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Documents Delivery                                                   | 5 minutes                |
| Good Delivery, Delivery from On-line Store (Small Box/Package, etc.) | 10 minutes               |
| Clothe Delivery (If customer wants to try it out)                    | 20 minutes               |
| Delivery of Big Boxes/Packages (Furniture, etc.)                     | 40 minutes               |

Please choose Service Time correctly to make the most of the route optimization.&#x20;
